            Salt- and freshwater
          </h2>
          <p class="text_description">
            It is known there is saltwater and freshwater. The reason fish simply cannot swim in both waters is the following: Sea water is saltier than the fish, and salt attacts water, and as a result, the fish constantly loses water through its skin, dehydrating it completely. 
          </p>
          <p class="text_description">
            In contrast, saltwater fish are saltier than its environment, so water permanently threatens to flood its body.
          </p>
          <p class="text_description">
            That's why freshwater and saltwater fish will never meet. To further analyse this, There is a divide phenomenon in the certain areas known as the halocline, a paper thin layer perfectly seperating the two aquatic worlds apart.

            Water, as a fundamental element of life and a vital resource, is studied scientifically through various disciplines and approaches to better understand its properties, behavior, and importance in different contexts, namely three vital ones.

            Meteorites and water
          </h2>
          <p class="text_description">
            Meteorites are known generally as immensly rare natural disasters and is known as what 
            wiped out the dinosaurs so long ago. What matters in this case however, is how rich in water these space rocks have. Ironicly, these rocks that bombarded the earth so long ago are what's responsible for the water we have at the present.
          </p>
          <p class="text_description">
            Astrobiologists have studied meteorite fragments, to further unravel the several mysteries of our solar system in depth. 
          </p>
          <p class="text_description">
            In their labs, the cosmic rocks are broken down to their components. Is it possible that not only water, but also the building blocks of life came to us from outer space?
